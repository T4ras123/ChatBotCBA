        "title": "What do I gain from making cashless payments?",
        "text": "Cashless payments are gradually becoming part of our daily life, but many of us still prefer cash because we are used to seeing and touching it. I don’t underestimate the power of habit, but let’s think together. Imagine you need to urgently pay a student’s tuition, a doctor, or a utility bill in cash. You are forced to take a break from work, overcome heavy traffic, reach the place, wait in a long line, often lose or forget your receipt, and return with the same difficulty. There’s no positive emotion in this experience.\nBut if you use mobile banking, that is, make transactions cashlessly, you’ll gain convenience and speed.\n More:\n․ You’ll save nerves and time,\n. The receipt will always be on your phone,\n. Payments can be done with one tap in a few seconds,\n. Ultimately, you’ll receive bonuses and discounts.\nMake your life easier, be well-off.\n",

        "text": "In some cases, there may be fees for cashless payments, while in others, there may not be; it is important to check before making a transaction.\nIf you are an individual, not a sole entrepreneur or business, you don’t pay fees when:\n-\tShopping in stores, using services, and paying by card or e-wallet. In this case, you may even receive discounts, bonuses, or cashback.\nThere’s no fee when:\n-\tMaking online purchases and payments,\n-\tDoing certain transactions via mobile banking, like paying utility bills.\nAnd remember, whether buying goods or paying for services with cash or cashless, the price should not differ.\nHowever, some transactions may incur fees.\nFamiliarize yourself with fees:\nFor example:\n-\tTransferring money from one card to another.\n-\tPaying via a payment terminal.\n-\tMaking certain payments via mobile banking, like property tax, taxes, fees, or payments related to the traffic police.\n-\tIn some cases, a transfer from your account to another may incur fees, like transferring money from a local currency account to a foreign currency account.\nGenerally, when making payments or transfers via mobile banking or terminals, the fee amount is displayed during the transaction.

        "title": "Card details, PIN, and CVV codes: What are they?",
        "text": "Let’s review some important card-related details.\nThe card number is the series of digits on the card. It is used for card-to-card transfers, loading money onto the card, making online purchases, and identifying the card.\nThe PIN code is not on the card, as it should be known only by you and not by the police, neighbors, or even bank staff. The PIN is a personal identification password needed for cash withdrawals from ATMs or for purchases via POS terminals.\nThe CVV code is the number on the back of the card used for online transactions. It is an extra security measure to prevent online fraud. The CVV code should also be kept confidential and not entered on unreliable websites.\nIf someone knows your card number, expiration date, name, and CVV code, they can make purchases and steal money in your name. If someone also has your card and knows your PIN, they can withdraw cash and make purchases. Do not write the PIN on the card or keep it with the card. Protect your information, be well-off.\n",

        "title": "Common Financial Frauds 1 - Phishing",
        "text": "Financial frauds are becoming increasingly common. However, it is possible to protect yourself from them. If you’re informed, you’re protected.\nFor example, you open your email and read, surprisingly, that you have inherited a fortune. But to receive a few million dollars per the deceased's last will, you first need to pay a few hundred dollars. This is called phishing. Don’t click on suspicious links or provide data to fraudsters.\nAnother example: while browsing online, a pop-up window appears, excitedly telling you that you are the hundred thousandth visitor and have won a big prize. You only need to register and provide your bank card details. You never receive the prize, and unexplained charges begin to appear on your card.\nIt’s impossible to know all frauds, but you can develop a sense to detect too-good-to-be-true offers and refuse them without hesitation. Just keeping what you have is a gain. Be informed, be well-off.\n",

        "text": "Online shopping has become part of our daily life. While it offers many advantages, online shopping also carries risks. You may end up with your card details in the hands of dishonest people, lose money, or not receive your purchase. To avoid these situations, follow two key principles: caution and awareness.\nYou may have heard the saying, ‘tested yogurt is better than untested curd,’ so only use trusted, well-known websites. Before making a purchase on the site, ask yourself: if I get overcharged or don’t receive the product, will the store resolve the issue?\n-\tInstead of social media platforms, look for the official website or a well-known online store and make purchases there.\n-\tDon’t provide your card and personal details to suspicious sites.\n-\tIf you notice suspicious charges on your card, immediately block it and notify the bank.\nBe vigilant, be well-off.\n",
